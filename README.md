# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption

Caesar cipher is a encryption technique in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. When dealing with alphabets we use ROT-13, which means the algorithm swaps an alphabet with the alphabet 13 position after it. When dealing with numbers we use ROT – 5, which means the algorithm swaps a number with the number 5 positions after it.

Eg: The sentence, “The year is 2019” will be encrypted as “Gur lrne vf 7564”.

The program allows us to encode and decode using Caesar Cipher
